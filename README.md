# DataPillager
Most GIS people have had a need to download data at some point. What do you do if there isn't a handy package to download, but you have access to a REST service containing the data?
Enter the Data Pillager. 
A Python script to download data from Esri services (ArcGIS Server, ArcGIS Online).
Designed to run from an Arc toolbox (supplied).
Requires a licensed install of Esri ArcGIS (for the arcpy dependency).
